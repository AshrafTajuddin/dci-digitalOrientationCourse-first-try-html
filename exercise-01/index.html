<p > It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>

  <p >Many desktop publishing <span style="border: 1px solid black; color: black">packages and web page <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools !</a>editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text</span>, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br><br> Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by <strong>accident</strong>, <em>  sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</em>
